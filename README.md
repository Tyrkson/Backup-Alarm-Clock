Backup Alarm Clock

It was made with my high school classmate as a school project. The main idea of this app is to be as a typical alarm clock, but with one exception. Every time when the user forgots to turn off the alarm, the app will send an SMS to a contact, chosen by a user. For example user's mom, so then mom could know that her child (user) has slept in and needs to come and wake him/her up by herself.

NB! This app probably doesn't work perfectly and the last time I tested it, was in 2018.
